<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p>Chungshan District is the fourth and last of the districts of
Kwangtung Province to be covered in the Consulate General’s
series of Indices of Clan Names by Villages. With its publication,
the major immigration fraud producing area, i.e. Toishan,
Sunwui, Hoiping and Chungshan Districts, has been indexed.
This office will continue to collect material on other areas
which to date have contributed relatively smaller number of
immigrants to the United States, such as Hok Shan, Tung Kun,
Yen Ping, Po On, Fa, Wai Yeung and Nam Hoi Districts, but it
is not planned at this time to publish any further bound indices.
Information on the above listed districts, however, may be had
upon inquiry.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Index</h2>

<p>Chungshan District is divided into nine areas which in turn
are divided into smaller jurisdictional groupings of villages or
lays termed heungs or bos. However, the villages in Chungshan
are comparatively larger than those in the other districts covered
by our indices and therefore many of these villages are occupied
by more than one clan. This is particularly true of the villages
found in the 3rd, 7th and 9th areas. Because of their large
size, these villages are often referred to erroneously as heungs
by the inhabitants. The areas in Chungshan District, unlike
those in other districts, have names as well as numbers, and
these too are sometimes erroneously given as heungs by the
inhabitants. In Chungshan there are also several cities and large
towns which in this index are treated as if they were separate
heungs.</p>

<p>To effectively use this index it is necessary to know the
Subject’s heung as well as his village. The heungs to be found
in Chungshan District are listed alphabetically and also by STC
in tabbed sections following. The area names used in Chungshan
District are also listed in like fashion. Once the heung has been
located, the finding of the proper village is relatively easy.
All villages in a heung are listed in three ways, by romanized
version of the name, by STC numbers and in Chinese characters.
With each village is listed the clan name or names of the family
or families occupying the village, also in romanized version,
STC numbers and Chinese characters.</p>

<p>All heungs are keyed to a map of Chungshan District which
will be found in the tabbed section immediately following the
listings of heungs. This map in turn is keyed to the grid
coordinates of the U. S. Army Map Service Series covering
Kwangtung Province.</p>

<p>In addition to map location, the name of the market or
markets in or near the heung is also given in each heung listing.</p>

<h2>Standardized Romanization</h2>

<p>The system of romanization of place names and surnames
used in this index is that employed by the Hong Kong Police
Department. For example, character 1776 which can be variously
romanized as CHUI, CHUEY, TSUI has been standardized
as TSUI.</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>

<p>It is the considered opinion of persons who have been
working for several years with the information contained in this
index that it includes about 90% of all the villages to be found
in Chungshan District. However, since future interviews with
applicants for consular services at this post should result in new
and more complete data being developed, this index will be
reviewed from time to time and if changes are found necessary,
amendment notices will be issued to all holders of the index.
Any suggestions, comments, and specially any information which
might be useful in correcting the index are respectfully requested.
All such correspondence should be addressed to the American
Consulate General, Hong Kong, Attention: Control Officer,
Consular Section, and should be forwarded through official
channels.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>Grateful acknowledgement is made to the many investigators
and clerks, both American and local, who have contributed many
hours of time in the compilation of this work. This office is
also deeply indebted to the General Services Officer at this post
who has found the money necessary to make this, the last volume
in the series, possible.</p>
