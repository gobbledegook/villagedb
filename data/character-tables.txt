The STC (Standard Telegraph Code) table is based on the Unihan data, supplemented
by various tables of varying quality found on the internet in 2001 and 2002
(which may or may not still be around). Over time the table has been updated
to match the usage in the Village Indexes. A small number of codes have been added
to help input characters which originally had no codes. These start at 9701
and can be considered a sort of private use area.

Jyutping and Pinyin tables were based on data from the LSHK and Chih-Hao Tsai,
respectively. For characters with multiple readings, the one most often used
in the Village Indexes has been chosen. A handful of exceptional forms require
special handling. See the script util/rectify-names.pl for an example of this.
