<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This work is a companion to the “Index of Clan Names
by Villages for Toishan District”, which was published in
October 1963. With the publishing of this Index and a
similar one for Hoiping District, which is now at the
printer’s, we will have covered three of the four districts of
Kwangtung which have provided the largest number of
Chinese emigrants to the United States. Research on the
remaining district, Chungshan, is nearing completion and
we hope that a Chungshan Index can be published sometime this year.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Index</h2>

<p>The majority of Sunwui natives in the United States
originated from one of the following sections of the District:
from the eighth area, or Ku Cheng as it is commonly
called; from those areas in the vicinity of Sunwui City
and Kong Moon City; and from the areas along the railway
which linked Sunwui and Toishan.</p>

<p>As in other districts, each of Sunwui’s eight areas is
divided into smaller jurisdictional units called heungs. Some
of the large heungs are further divided into sub-heungs
or bos. In order to locate a particular village in this Index
it is essential to know the name of the heung in which it
is situated. The heungs can be found by means of the
table of contents beginning on page III. Names of the
heungs are provided both in romanized forms and in STC’s
(Standard Telegraphic Code).</p>

<p>The heungs are arranged in the Index according to
areas. Each section contains the map location of the
heung, principal market(s) and a list of all known villages
and clan names. Ail names are rendered in a romanized
form, in Chinese characters and in STC’s.</p>

<p>In this Index as in the Toishan Index, we have adopted
the system of romanization which is used in the Consulate
General in Hong Kong. It is recommended that, as a
double check, subjects be requested to furnish both the
Chinese characters and romanized forms for all names.</p>

<p>All heungs and bos found in the Index are keyed to
the map of Sunwui District which will be found in the
tabbed section immediately following the STC Listing of
Heungs and Bos. This map itself is keyed to the grid
Kwangtung Province.</p>

<p>This Index, in its present form, contains all the
information on Sunwui which is avalable to us. However,
it is by no means complete. Research on this district is
continuing and as further information is obtained it will
be distributed. In the meantime, suggestions or comments
from the users of this Index woud be appreciated.
Correspondence should be addressed to the Chief, Consular
Section, American Consulate General, Hong Kong, Attention:
Control Officer, and should be forwarded through
official channels.</p>

<p>We are once again indebted to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and to the General Services Officer
of the Consulate General for providing the funds for the
publication of this Index.</p>
