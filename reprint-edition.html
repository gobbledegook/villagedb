<h1>NOTE FOR THE REPRINT EDITION</h1>

<p>
Four districts in Kwangtung Province -- Toishan, Sunwui, Hoiping, and Chungshan --
have previously contributed most of the Chinese who immigrated into the United
States yearly. Although the immigration pattern has changed during the last two
decades, it is believed that people from the above-mentioned four districts or
descendants of persons who migrated here from those districts still form the greater
majority of the ethnical Chinese living in the continental United States today.
</p>


<p>
The Control Unit of the Consular Section in the American Consulate General in Hong
Kong under took to compile indexes of clan names by villages for the four districts
for the use of government agencies in investigating suspected frauds involving
Chinese illegal immigration into the United States and in determining the veracity
of a large number of visa, passport and federal benefit applications. As a result,
the first of what turned out to be a four-part series -- the index for Toishan
District -- was published in October 1963, followed by the Sunwui index in January
of 1965, the Hoiping index in May, and the Chungshan index apparently in 1966.
</p>


<p>
Prior to 1949, like districts elsewhere in China, Toishan, Sunwui, Hoiping, and
Chungshan were divided into areas, which in turn were divided into smaller
jurisdictional groupings of villages termed <em>heung</em> (鄉) or <em>bo</em> (堡).
In the four indexes, all known villages of the four districts are listed in three
ways: by romanized version of the name, by Chinese standard telegraphic code
(S.T.C.) numbers, and in Chinese characters. With each village is listed the clan
name or names of the family or families occupying the village, also in romanized
version, S.T.C. numbers, and Chinese characters.
</p>


<p>
As a source of information in the investigation of past immigration frauds, the
indexes may have already served the purpose for which they were compiled. As a
reference source in any serious research into the geography, sociology and history
of the four districts of Kwangtung, however, they have not outlived their usefulness
-- something which the compilers themselves did not perhaps envisage when they began
their work. It was with this realization that the Chinese Center accepted with
gratitude the suggestion of Mr. Him Mark Lai, president of the Chinese Historical
Society of America, with head offices at 357 Union Street, San Francisco, Calif.
94133, to include the four volumes in its reproduction program.
