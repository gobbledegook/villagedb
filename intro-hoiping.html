<p>The Hoiping Index is the third in a series of texts
to be published on the four districts of Kwangtung which
have contributed the majority of Chinese emigrants to
the United States.</p>

<h2>Hoiping District</h2>

<p>Prior to World War II, Hoiping District was divided
into ten areas and more than one hundred smaller
jurisdictional units called heungs. After the end of the
War, these areas were consolidated into four areas, each
of which was composed of about fifteen heungs. In
addition, there were four independent townships: Chong
Shing, Chek Hom, Cheung Sha, Shui How. In 1956
Hoiping District was again reapportioned and at present
comprises forty-seven heungs and six townships.</p>

<p>The divisions used in this Index are those existing
in the postwar period upto 1956. For reference, the
current names of heungs and townships in Hoiping District
are contained in The Annex beginning on page 114.</p>

<p>The villages in Hoiping District are listed in the Index
according to the heung in which they are situated. Each
section of the Index contains the name of the heung, the
number of the area in which it is located, the name of
the principal market(s), and a list of the villages together
with the names of the clans. These sections can be located
by means of the Table of Contents beginning on page 1.
In addition, each section shows the map co-ordinates of the
heung. These co-ordinates are keyed to the map of Hoiping
District following page VI. This map is itself keyed to the
grid co-ordinates of the U.S. Army Map Services Series
governing Kwangtung Province.</p>

<p>The system of romanization of place names and
surnames used in this Index is that employed by the Hong
Kong Police Force. Character 6223 for example, which
can be variously romanized as TAM, TOM, HOM, has been
standardized as TAM.</p>

<p>The Index as it now stands represents all the Hoiping
village information contained in the Consulate General
files. This information is being continually expanded and
from time to time amendments and additions will be
forwarded to holders of this text.</p>

<p>Acknowledgement is made to the staff of the Research
Sub-Unit who aided in the gathering and evaluation of
village data and to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and to the General Service Office who contributed
the funds for publication.</p>
